## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Tiktok: this app is great for all audiences all across the border, but is more geared towards the youth. TikTok is an app that includes nice features such as uploading your own TikTok, direct messaging,  and reposting a TikTok that you like or is relatable. To upload, you might want to upload stuff from your camera roll, or you can make your tiktoks! Creating Tiktoks is easy and fun, you can also use captions and text-to-speech to describe the Tiktok that is created.
2. Instagram: It's one of the main social media platforms for a reason! Instagram's ability to communicate in all aspects makes it the prominent platform that it is in today's world. One very useful feature is direct messaging. Direct Messaging on Instagram includes texting, voice messages, and even video calling. Another feature is to easily navigate people's posts through hashtags. Another feature that is relatively new to the app is to create reels! This feature can allow users to not just share their posts, but to be creative with reels.
3. Discord: This platform allows users to connect with other users uniquely. One useful feature is being able to join a channel in a group chat. Each channel has its purpose in the group chat, allowing users to see messages in an organized way. Unlike some social media apps, not only can you send images and videos, but you can also send files! One last feature that is unique about the platform is that you can have roles depending on the power and character the user plays in the chat. If  they can moderate the chat, they can be able to ban or kick whoever might be bending the rules that the chat has.
4. Garageband: This app is more notable for musical production and makes it easier for all Apple users to potentially excel musically. This app has so many features, but one feature one can find fascinating is the "Auto-Tune" feature. This feature could be used to tune your voice in the right tone, and you can control the amount of it being used to make it sound more natural. Another is the beat-making feature that you can also record. With numerous drum kits, you can select which one would sound good for the beat you're creating, depending on the style of sound that you're going for.

## App Idea
HarmonyHub is an ideal choice as it conveys the idea of a central place where individuals can come together, connect, and create harmonious melodies. HarmonyHub provides a user-friendly interface where artists can upload their original tracks, allowing listeners to explore various genres and discover new talent. To collaborate, the app could incorporate features like virtual jam sessions or remix contests, enabling users to interact with artists directly or even contribute their own musical ideas. HarmonyHub includes a social networking aspect where users can follow their favorite artists, share playlists, and engage in discussions about music. This would create a vibrant community of like-minded individuals who appreciate creativity and want to actively participate in the music-making process. An app like HarmonyHub would revolutionize the way creatives put their music out for people to listen to by providing an interactive platform that offers collaboration between artists and listeners. With its catchy name and innovative features, this app has the potential to empower musicians while offering an engaging experience for all music lovers. 

## Notes

I had trouble trying to navigate the tools to create the app. I had to read closely to make sure I followed through the instructions properly. I was also dragging the storyboard to the wrong part of the "ViewController" class. I was trying to figure it out, so I had to re-do it 2 times to get it right. Nevertheless, I enjoyed doing this project and hope to code way more with Swift!
